## Micrograd Rust: Intuitive Neural Network Exploration in Rust
## Description:

### Micrograd Rust is a self-contained Rust project exploring neural network development using Andrej Karpathy's micrograd framework. It's designed to help you:

-   Visualize Backpropagation: Build expressions as a graph, making backpropagation more intuitive and easier to grasp.
-   Experiment with Architectures: Craft custom neural networks using flexible Neuron and Layer structs.
-   Understand Core Concepts: Follow a well-commented MLP example showcasing the library's capabilities.
### Learning Approach:

-   Graph Construction: Explore how to build networks as graphs of operations and variables.
-   Automatic Differentiation: Dive into autograd for efficient backpropagation without manual gradient calculations.
-   Custom Components: Learn to design your own neurons and layers for in-depth network understanding.
-   Hands-on Example: Implement an MLP network step-by-step to solidify your understanding.
### Structure:

-   core: Contains the fundamental building blocks like Neuron and Layer.
-   example: Provides a MLP implementation demonstrating usage.
-   utils: Houses utility functions and helper code.
### Disclaimer:

This project is primarily for personal learning and experimentation, not intended for wider distribution as a framework.

## Getting Started:

- Clone or download the repository.
- Build the project: cargo build
- Explore the code, run the example, and learn!
## Resources:

- Andrej Karpathy's micrograd: [micrograd python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0&pp=ygUPYW5kcmVqIGthcnBhdGh5)
- Rust Programming Language: [Link to Rust Lang](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn)
### Further Exploration:

Modify the MLP example to experiment with different architectures.
Implement other neural network algorithms using the available building blocks.
Delve deeper into autograd's mechanics and optimization techniques.
Enjoy your neural network journey in Rust!


### Old Note:
This is a rewrite of my RustANN Project. Decided to Archive it since I didn't really like its codebase
Hope this turns out with better Quality
Hope I don't procrastinate this project like its predecessor xD
